# General
- Local view of universe expands over time through continued gameplay
- Players eventually "ascend" and achieve higher power
- Players will be able to use fully client side macros
- Macros will be limited strictly to only what the user could do with a mouse or keyboard

# Game progression
- Start small, you begin with a village to control
- Villages move to cities(gradual?), and you must stave off enemies and win the support of your people
- You now have space flight, but not FTL
- You have expanded and met your first intergalactic enemy
- You have ascended and lost control of your previous forces

The goal of the game is to ascend, OR to dominate the universe. You don't have to ascend, but it's certainly an
option for advanced players.

# Map
I've always liked the ideas of tiles, so clear cut...
Anyway:
- The map is only revealed once you've explored it (duh moment)
- Each tile represents something different in each level
