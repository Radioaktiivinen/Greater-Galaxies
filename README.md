Greater-Galaxies
================

You start out with a single town, and work up to galactic overlord, and then you die and ascend to gain control over the universe. The fun part is that once you've become a galactic overlord you still have to micro all the solar-systems under your command, which makes macros imperative. Macros will be scripted in Lua and will only have client-side repercussions(so they can only do what a play could do).

You'll be able to zoom in and out as far as your current domain allows, so the village leader can't zoom out to the solar system, and the galactic overlord can't see various control overlays that the ascended players can.

Ascended players have achieved so much that they get their own personal battle-field, all of the universe. They can battle each other directly for control over systems(systems which are controlled by lower players, but the lower players don't know who controls their systems) or to descend other ascended players.

We'll also need a chat system and a group system.

Project management
==================
Project planning will begin June seventh.

You may continue to sign up if you wish, but you _MUST_ join by the seventh or you will be excluded.

Project members, please put some thought into what you want the project to be, and the tools you'd like to use (git, mercurial, svn). Nightname has joined but will be inactive until he's finished his examinations.

To better split up positions, the game will be split in MVC fashion.

Positions
---------

**Reserved:**
- Task managers (Accepts task requests and distributes tasks accordingly)
- Standards enforcer (Tags code that doesn't comply to group standards)

**Unfilled positions:**
- Designer (Creates all game graphics, preferred)
- Abstraction crew (Locates large groups of common objects that could be abstracted safely and efficiently without harm to the code base)

**Positions:**
- Controller devs (Input)
- Model devs (Data)
- View devs (Graphics)
- Scripters (All purpose)

Managing tasks
--------------

Tasks will be tagged appropriately and divided to programmers and scripters in such a way as to keep each focused on their independent tasks. Each programmer will have up to TWO tasks maximum to deal with at a time. Each scripter can have up to THREE tasks maximum to deal with at a time. Programmers will be able to choose TWO positions, one main and one sub. Scripters will be given "general" scripting tasks to accomplish.

Programmers will be able to generate scripting tasks, and scripters will be able to generate Lua VM feature requests. All groups will have access to the actual repository.

Thoughts
--------
- Maybe there should be a "task board" where you can accept tasks and report on progress.
- We really need to find a designer... :/
